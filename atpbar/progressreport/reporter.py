class ProgressReporter:
    """A progress reporter

    This class sends progress reports. The reports will be picked up
    by the pickup (`ProgressReportPickup`), which uses the reports,
    for example, to update `ProgressBar` on the screen.

    An instance of this class is initialized with a message queue::

        reporter = ProgressReporter(queue)

    The pickup, which is running in a sub-thread of the main process,
    needs to have the same queue.

    A report can be sent as::

        reporter.report(report)

    This method can be frequently called multiple times. However,
    after sending one report, the reporter wait for a certain
    ``interval`` (0.1 seconds by default) before sending another
    report of the same task. Reports from the same task received
    within this interval will be discarded. The exception for this is
    the last report. The last report, which indicates the completion
    of the task, will be always sent to the progress monitor
    regardless of whether it is given within the interval.

    Parameters
    ----------
    queue : multiprocessing.Queue
        The queue through which this class sends progress reports.
